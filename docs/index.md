# Overview

This documentation provides information on methods for hosting and facilitating data science educational workshops, in particular short (1-2 week) interactive, participant-driven events. The approaches described here come out of experimentation with the [hackweek model](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/36/8872.short) designed within the [Moore/Sloan Data Science Environment](http://msdse.org/).
