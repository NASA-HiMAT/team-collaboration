# Overview

Increasingly, funding agencies are asking scientists to work collaboratively across teams to solve complex challenges. While scientists likely acknowledge the value of collaborative work, they are rarely offered a roadmap for how to form and sustain functioning teams outside of their existing network of colleagues. Moreover, there are few resources available outlining both the benefits and costs of adding collaborations to an already extensive list of research priorities in any given project.

This documentation offers an initial roadmap for building new collaborations within the paramaters of common funding models in the United States. Here agencies such as the National Science Foundataion (NSF) and the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) award ten or so institutions funding over a 3-5 year period to address a specific research problem. We aim to share lessons learned from leading and facilitating several uniquely collaborative efforts funded by NASA since about 2016.

We recognize there are many ways to build highly collaborative teams. What is offered here is based on our direct experience in designing collaborative structures within a community composed primarily of earth scientists. We hope this documentation will continue to evolve as we test and refine new methods, and that we can continue to design collaborative structures that meet the needs of a diversity of scientific domains.
