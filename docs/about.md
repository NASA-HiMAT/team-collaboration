We wish to acknowledge the incredible group of scientists who co-created much of what we present here during the 2016-2019 NASA High Mountain Asia Team project.

# Contributing

We recognize there are many ways to build highly collaborative teams. What is offered here is based on our direct experience in designing collaborative structures within a community composed primarily of earth scientists. We hope this documentation will continue to evolve as we test and refine new methods. We welcome contributions to this document at our [GitHub page](https://github.com/highmountainasia/team-collaboration) or via e-mail to Anthony Arendt ([arendta@uw.edu](mailto:arendta@uw.edu)).
