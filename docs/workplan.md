## Discovering Complementary and Overlapping Work

Once a team is formed the building of collaborative structures can begin. One of the greatest potential barriers to cross-team collaboration is that multiple teams may have proposed to do similar tasks. This may set up a tension within the group as each researcher tries to be the first to publish and gain credit for a specific activitity. Therefore it is important that structures be put in place to facilitate both a discovery of overlapping work, as well an opportunity for teams to adjust their workplans so that their work can be collaborative and complementary.
  
!!! note "HiMAT Case study"
    At the start of the HiMAT project, the program manager and science team lead identified overlapping tasks in several proposals. We initiated small group calls to talk through areas of overlap and to discuss possibilities for reducing duplication of effort. These conversations continued during the first in-person team meeting. Shortly after the team meeting, Principal Investigators were asked to submit revised statements of work that helped streamline areas of overlap. In several cases individuals let go of some proposed tasks, recognizing that others had more advanced capabilities. In other cases, dupilcation of effort was seen as a positive way to check each other's work and to come at a problem from multiple directions.

## Science Traceability Matrix

As everyone gets more clear on their objectives and proposed activities, it helps to generate a high-level roadmaps that succinctly describes what each team plans to do. One way to achieve this is to invite each team to build a Science Traceability Matrix. We borrow this concept from NASA mission planning activities that link science objectives to functional requirements and specifications of satellites. 

Here is a sample Science Traceability Matrix from HiMAT:
