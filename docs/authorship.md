# Attribution of Effort

Academic success is traditionally measured in terms of numbers of publications. As scientific research becomes increasingly collaborative, these traditional metrics may no longer be capable of capturing the full scope of effort that creates the modern scientific landscape. Collaboration requires an attention to the building of relationships between individuals and research teams, all of which takes time and effort. We advocate for new approaches that reward scientists in non-traditional ways that could include contributions to open-source community software libraries, participation in community building workshops and model intercomparison projects.
