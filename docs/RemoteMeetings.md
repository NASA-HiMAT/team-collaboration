# Remote Meetings

Remote meetings provide opportunities for:

* staying connected to what is happening on other teams
* learning about new datasets, models, manuscripts
* logistical planning for upcoming events
* identifying and eliminating roadblocks to collaboration
* building team cohesion and social structures

Facilitating remote meetings is often more challenging than in person meetings. We recommend using video conferencing software such as [zoom](https://zoom.us) and inviting people to keep their video on but to mute their sound when not speaking.

Meeting should be scheduled at times that best accommodate the diversity of time zones where team members are located. As for [In-person meetings](InPersonMeetings.md), there should always be an agenda and an overall purpose for coming together.
