# Synthesis

As teams begin generating results it is the role of the science team lead to begin identifying connections and opportunities for integration and synthesis. Below we list a series of potential activities that can enhance the group's capabilities to recognize and act on these collaboration opportunities. 

## Mapping Manuscripts

An effective way to foster collaboration is to ensure everyone is aware about each other's progress in writing manuscripts. The project manager should maintain a running spreadsheet that tracks every paper generated under support of the award. 

!!! note "HiMAT manuscript mapping"
    At one of our in-person meetings we invited everyone to write down the name of every manuscript (in preparation, submission or press) on a small flash card. We then had everyone transfer these to a timeline written on a large white-board. Next, dependencies between manuscripts were drawn. This was a helpful way to visualize the optimum sequencing of events as people navigated their various writing commitments.
