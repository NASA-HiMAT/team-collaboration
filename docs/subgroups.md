# Sub-Groups

Depending on overall team size it often makes sense to form sub-groups that can collaborate on specific project objectives. An advantage of forming sub-groups is that collaborative exchanges tend to be more efficient. By narrowing the scope of disciplinary focus, teams can hone in on specific project goals and achieve research milestones more rapidly than they might in larger teams. Small groups also tend to be more adaptable to change and can respond more nimbly to any unexpected shifts in research priorities than larger teams. 

A potential disadvantage to forming sub-groups is that some people may feel they need to join every sub-group so that they do not feel left out of any team exchanges. It is also possible for sub-groups to become too narrow in their focus, cutting them off from cross disciplinary exchanges that might have otherwise enhanced opportunities for new collaborative ideas to emerge. Below we offer recommendations for how best to navigate the formation, scope and content of sub-group activities within the lifespan of a collaborative project.

## Formation

Discussions about the possibility for sub-group formation should occur early in the project lifecycle. Rather than trying to proscribe what project components might benefit from the formation of sub-groups, which will be difficult to do before the work has begun, the group should instead establish structures to recognize when the time might be right to consider breaking into smaller teams. Here are some ideas for the formation of subgroups.
