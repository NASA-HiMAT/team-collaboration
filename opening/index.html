                <h1 id="opening-session">Opening Session</h1>
<p>The opening session provides organizers with a unique opportunity to set the overall tone of the event. Hackweeks are a relatively new learning model, so participants may arrive on the first day not knowing quite what to expect. Careful planning of the opening session can help alleviate participant anxiety by establishing a code of conduct and norms of behavior, and setting intentions around building a welcoming learning environment.</p>
<p>We detail below a variety of topics and activities that can be included in the opening session. We have experimented with opening sessions lasting as long as 1.5 hours. The length you choose will depend on the total number of activities planned.</p>
<h2 id="welcoming-remarks">Welcoming Remarks</h2>
<p>Usually the event begins with brief opening remarks, often by the lead organizer of the hackweek. Topics in the welcoming remarks may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>acknowledging the substantial time commitment participants are making to attend the event</li>
<li>thanking organizers, tutorial leads and guest speakers</li>
<li>acknowledging sources of funding</li>
<li>speaking briefly about the history, formation and overall mission of the hackweek model</li>
<li>talking through logistics of the room setup, timing and location of breaks and meals and the overall schedule of the event</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="icebreaker">Icebreaker</h2>
<p>Hackweeks are designed to be highly interactive experiences, so we try to get people talking with each other early in the event. A well designed icebreaker can help participants explore connections with people they do not yet know, and get people thinking creatively about what they hope to accomplish during the event. Good icebreakers create a hospitable space for connection and conversation, while poorly conecived icebreakers put people on the spot and create a stressful social interaction, which should be avoided this early in the event. As with all facilitated activities, participants should be made aware that their involvement is by invitation and is not a required component of the event.</p>
<h3 id="impromptu-networking">Impromptu Networking</h3>
<p>The purpose of <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/2-impromptu-networking/">impromput networking</a> is to invite one-on-one conversation with people in the room you have not yet met. Participants are invited to find a partner and have each person speak for two minutes in response to a question provided by the organizer. The question should be displayed in large font on the projector for eveyone to see. Questions we have tried in past events include:</p>
<ul>
<li>"What would you like to get from and give to this community in the coming week?"</li>
<li>"What data science challenge are you most interested in exploring right now?"</li>
<li>"What is the most important thing you would like to accomplish this week?"</li>
</ul>
<p>This activity usually occurs in three rounds. After speaking with one person during the 4 minutes provided, the organizer indicates it is time to find a new person (for example by ringing chimes), and the conversation begins again in response to the same question. While it may seem redundant to keep repeating your response to the same question, this repetition often leads to greater depth as you become more and more clear in your response.</p>
<h3 id="mad-tea">Mad Tea</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/mad-tea/">Mad tea</a> involves arranging participants in two concentric circles, with the inside circle facing outward, and the outside circle facing inward. Participants are invited to respond to a series of questions that should be posted in large fonts on a screen(s) that can be seen by everyone. Participants respond to the question in conversation with the person who happens to be facing them in the circle. Each person speak for a brief 30 second period. When the organizer rings the chimes, the participants should take two steps left/right as instructed, so that they are now facing a different person. A new question is posted and the conversation begins again. Questions should be open-ended. Examples we have used in the past include:</p>
<ul>
<li>"What first inspired me in the work is..."</li>
<li>"A challenge I hope we can make progress on is..."</li>
<li>"I belong at this hackweek because..."</li>
<li>"I know I am in a positive learning environment when..."</li>
<li>"One of my greatest strengths is..."</li>
<li>"I know a team is functioning well when..."</li>
<li>"Something I plan to give to this community is..."</li>
</ul>
<p>In our experience, mad tea can be a noisy and highly energetic experience! Therefore providing clear instructions in advance, and having a good mechanism for signaling the rotation of the circles that can be heard by everyone, is especially important. The room also needs to be large enough to accommodate this particular structure. The rapid nature of this activity is designed to help people not over-think their responses, and to provide opportunities to speak with many different people. We feel it also helps people bring their awareness to their sense of belonging at the event, and the various ways they will navigate team dynamics and the challenges and opportunities of this learning environment.</p>
<h3 id="drawing-together">Drawing Together</h3>
<p>At hackweeks we all spend a lot of time looking at a computer screen, which can be a barrier to forming connections with other participants. This activity encourages people to interact in a more tactile way through hand drawings and sketches. Prior to the start of the event, we attach large strips of poster paper to the meeting room walls, and provide a variety of drawing and writing tools. Participants are then invited to form small groups and share ideas through their drawings. </p>
<p>Astrohackweek has used this approach at the opening of their event. Particpants were invited to share a sketch of a data visualization representing some project they were currently working on. The intention behind this activity is to enable everyone to talk about the principles behind data visualization, even if they do not yet have the coding skills to implement such approaches. Our hope was that this helped foster conversations, while minimize anxiety for those participants at the early stages of their data science careers. </p>
<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>The code of conduct defines the rules and acceptable behaviors of participants during the event. All hackweeks post their code of conduct online (<a href="https://geohackweek.github.io/wiki/code_of_conduct.html">example code of conduct</a>) and require participants to have read and agree to these terms before they register for the event. </p>
<p>During the opening session we draw everyone's attention to the code of conduct again as a way to emphasize its importance. We recommend providing a handout with the code of conduct listed in writing, and talking through the various options participants have to report a code of conduct violation.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-welcoming-learning-community">Creating a Welcoming Learning Community</h2>
<p>Whereas the code of conduct provides a list of rules describing activities that must be avoided, this section focuses on ways the group can actively create a postive learning community. We begin this section with a brief introduction to the conecpt of <a href="https://geohackweek.github.io/wiki/learning_community.html">learning communities</a>, and then talk about the behaviors that have been shown to foster the development of such communities.</p>
<p>Geohackweek used a simple structure to explore these behaviors. Participants were given a printout of the list of behaviors, and two instructors read through the list in sequence. Then participants were invited to turn to their neighbor and respond to these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Which of these behaviors resonates most with you?"</li>
<li>"Which of these behaviors seems most challenging to you?"</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these activities was to give participants a chance to think more deeply about how their individual behaviors might impact the learning environment created during the coming week.</p>
