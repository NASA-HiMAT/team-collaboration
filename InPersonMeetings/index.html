                <h1 id="in-person-meetings">In-Person Meetings</h1>
<p>It's remarkable, iven all of the scientific innovations that have occurred during the past century, that scientists continue to rely on a relatively limited range of communication tools when they gather together in person. Despite some signs of recent change, the majority of scientific workshops rely almost entirely on presentations as a mode of communication. Presentations involve the one-way transfer of information from a speaker to an audience of passive listeners. While presentations do have a place in scientific communcation, serving primarily to convey new knowledge that will be of interest to a broad community, they are largely ineffective when it comes to building and maintaining team collaborations. We feel that presentations should be one of a broad spectrum of tools available to researchers when they gather together in person. Below we list a series of additional structures that we have experimented with in structuring in-person workshops.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-design">Meeting Design</h2>
<p>Planning for an in-person meeting should begin several months in advance of the event. We recommend assembling a small <em>design team</em> composed of several investigators who volunteer to assist in defining the purpose and structure of the workshop. Together with the science team lead, project manager and team facilitator, the group will design the workshop over a series of planning calls in the months prior to the event. The first planning call should focus on defining the overall purpose of calling the meeting. For example, a meeting focused on initial stages of team building for collaboration will have a different structure and design than one aimed at synthesizing new research findings.</p>
<p>Below we list many of the common reasons for gathering researchers together in person and provide recommended structures that maximize the liklihood for positive outcomes. We draw on past experience, trial and error and a collection of excellent facilitation tools called <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/">Liberating Structures</a>. We recognize that some of the approaches listed here are new ways of interacting, and should therefore be presented as something that is invitational rather than required. At the same time we want to emphasize that these structures are designed to unleash the creativity of all team members, both introvers and extroverts alike.</p>
<h3 id="getting-connected">Getting connected</h3>
<p>In person meetings provide a unique opportunity to connect with our colleagues on a human level, without the barriers of remote technologies. We believe that all workshops should begin with opportunities for connection in ways that transcend our typical scientific conversations. Additionally, workshops early in the project lifespan should dedicate more time in the schedule to activites that build relationships of trust, whereas later in the project these can be reduced (but not eliminated!) as people get to know each other better.</p>
<p>Our basic strategy for facilitating team connections is to invite people into small group conversations guided by a simple and clear prompt. We often use <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/2-impromptu-networking/">Impromptu Networking</a> or <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/">1-2-4-All</a> with an invitation like "What is one success in your life recently that you wish to share?" or "What do you hope to achive during this workshop?". For a more lively exchange we use <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/mad-tea/">Mad Tea</a> and include prompts such as "I know a team is functioning well when..." and "One skill I would like to improve on is...". </p>
