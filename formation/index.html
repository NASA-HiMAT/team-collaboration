                <h1 id="project-solicitation">Project Solicitation</h1>
<p>Collaborative team building begins with the writing of the funding solicitation. A solicitation is a short document advertising an opportunity for researchers to apply for funding to work on a specific project. Traditionally, researchers gather together a small handful of trusted colleagues and write a proposal aiming to convince the funding committee that their small group is best equipped, and has the best ideas, to solve the problem at hand, and should therefore be funded. By funding several such teams in any particular round of funding, the idea is that at least one or two teams will generate enough new ideas to move the field forward. This funding model has generated a lot of high impact science over the years.</p>
<p>But what if a resarch problem is too broad or complex for a single team to address? Many program managers have recognized a need for building connections across the handful of teams that do get funded in a project. This is usually motivated by a desire to reduce duplication of effort and to advance the science in ways that cannot be done in isolation. </p>
<p>A well crafted solicitation can set the stage for this collaboration to occur. The following elements are critical:</p>
<h2 id="motivate-the-collaboration">Motivate the collaboration</h2>
<p>Scientists are trained to work for long hours in isolation to accomplish highly complex tasks. They usually share this work with a small set of trusted colleagues, based on relationships formed over many years. Asking them to rapidly connect with a large group of new researchers takes effort that should be clearly justified. </p>
<p>A well crafted solicitation will provide a vision for what could be achieved through the extra effort invested in collaboration. Specific examples should be provided, for example the linking of modeling studies with field observations that will lead to improved validation and calibration. In our view, researchers should be encouraged to bring their specialty to the table (in this example, either modeling or field expertise) while describing how they would interface with teams having different expertise. One challenge we have identified in past collaborative efforts is that every team, perhaps in an effort to increase their chances to be funded, proposed to do every part of the collaboration pipeline, leaving us with multiple teams "trying to do it all". </p>
<h2 id="provide-clear-expectations">Provide clear expectations</h2>
<p>Research scientists who spend time writing proposals get very good at estimating how much time they should request in their budgets to cover the work that needs to get done. But when cross-team collaboration is added to the mix, it gets harder to know how much extra time this will take. Researchers may wonder, should I roll the collaboration in to the amount of time I would have asked for in a less-collaborative proposal? Should I double my request? Am I expected to do the collaboration on the side? A good solicitation will offer some parameters to aid in this decision process. Providing specific guidelines, for example that some percent of effort should be dedicated to collaboration, and to plan budgets accordingly, is ideal. </p>
<h2 id="provide-reporting-and-reward-structures">Provide reporting and reward structures</h2>
<p>Building and maintaining collaborations takes time that might otherwise be dedicated to writing papers and advancing one's own individual science objectives. Teams that engage most in a collaborative process may find themselves with fewer academic products to show for that fulfill traditional metrics, primarily numbers of papers published. A solicitation that truly wishes to build collaboration should describe other metrics for rewarding collaborations. This might include numbers of datasets shared, leading dedicated sub-groups, numbers of contributions to open-source software repositories, or other tasks. There should also be clear guidelines on how to report on these less traditional academic performance metrics.</p>
