Despite some signs of recent change, the majority of scientific workshops rely almost entirely on presentations as a mode of communication. Presentations involve the one-way transfer of information from a speaker to an audience of passive listeners. While presentations do have a place in scientific communcation, they are often ineffective when it comes to building and maintaining team collaborations. We feel that presentations should be one of a broad spectrum of tools available to researchers when they gather together in person. Below we list a series of additional structures that we have experimented with in designing in-person workshops. Attendees of the 2017 NASA HiMAT all-hands workshop in Seattle, WA Meeting Design Planning for an in-person meeting should begin several months in advance of the event. We recommend assembling a small design team composed of several investigators who volunteer to help plan the meeting together with the science team lead and facilitator. The first planning call should focus on defining the overall purpose of the workshop which will inform the structure and design. At a minimum, the layout of the event should be documented in a standard meeting agenda, but a better approach is to build a design story board that explicitly lists the purpose, content and structure of each activity ( here is a sample storyboard from our first HiMAT workshop). Below we list many of the common reasons for gathering researchers together in person and provide recommended structures that maximize the liklihood for positive outcomes. We draw on past experience, trial and error and a collection of excellent facilitation tools called Liberating Structures . The Importance of Invitations Many of our facilitation approaches aim to draw participants into specific practices, or to conduct some activities within a framework or microstructure. Although the purpose of these structures is to dismantle many of the unhealthy bahaviors that can occur in professional settings, some particants may not view them in this way, and may not be ready to participate. Therefore we always preface our activites with a reminder that everything is invitational, and that if someone is not interested in joining in, this is fine. Getting connected In person meetings provide a unique opportunity to connect with our colleagues on a human level, without the barriers of remote technologies. We believe that all workshops should begin with opportunities for connection in ways that transcend our typical scientific conversations. Additionally, workshops early in the project lifespan should dedicate more time in the schedule to activites that build relationships of trust, whereas later in the project these can be reduced (but not eliminated!) as people get to know each other better. Our basic strategy for facilitating team connections is to invite people into small group conversations guided by a simple and clear prompt. We often use Impromptu Networking or 1-2-4-All with an invitation like \"What is one success in your life recently that you wish to share?\" or \"What do you hope to achive during this workshop?\". For a more lively exchange we use Mad Tea and include prompts such as \"I know a team is functioning well when...\" and \"One skill I would like to improve on is...\". Creating a Positive Workshop Environment In-person workshops are one of the best times to articulated shared intentions around norms of behavior and codes of conduct . A code of conduct should be included as standard reference material within each workshop website (see below). Even for well-connected teams, beginning a meeting with a reminder about these foundational team elements helps create a welcoming environment where innovation can thrive. It also provides a mechanism for reporting violations to the code of conduct should these occur. It is important to remember that each time the group gathers together, there may be new members attending who need to be made aware of the boundaries and social parameters of the collaborative space. Workshops can also be particularly stressful and challenging, so even if norms of behavior have been discussed already in remote settings, they should be revisited when meeting in person. It is important to note that setting positive intentions around team conduct does not mean we expect or even wish to eliminate uncomfortable situations. A meeting in which all attendees are adhering to a strict code of conduct may still have many uncomfortable moments; in fact, these are often markers of people taking brave steps to push their edges and address complex, difficult topics. Strategic Planning Workshops are often used to chart a course toward some collective collaborative goals. Commonly there will be unstructured group discussions with key ideas filtering up to the science team lead who makes the final decions on where the team will go next. A challenge with this approach is that discussions might be dominated by extrovers or senior scientists, and many of the ideas across other levels of the group are never given a chance to surface. Additionally, this approach doesn't foster the emergence of a collective wisdom that can, under the right conditions, lead to more innovative and high impact research than is possible when following individual ideas. We suggest that a good starting point for any strategic planning is to hear from the leadership team about their overall approach to collaboration. When leaders are transparent about their process and are willing to be vulnerable in exposing what they know and do not know, this can create a greater sense that \"we are all in this together\". People will then be more likely to work in support of leadership goals and less fearful of sharing new ideas. One structure we have used in past workshops is the Celebrity Interview . Here the science team lead is invited into a conversation with a facilitator who asks questions that might be on everyone's mind. Questions might focus on learning more about that person's leadership style, hearing their viewpoint on key challenges for the team, and learning more about how they will manage complexity and conflict (a sample list of questions is here ). The participants are then offered an opportunity to follow up with clarifying questions. Ecocycle Planning is another structure that enables us to explore the full range of existing activities within a team, identify obstacles and pinpoint opportunities for future growth. Other intriguing frameworks we have not yet tried include the Cynefin Framework and Future Backwards . Sharing New Research Findings Sharing our latest work with our colleagues is a primary motivation for attending a workshop, and this is traditionally accomplished with a series of presentations from each investigator on the team. Presentations are notorious for consuming a substantial portion of a workshop agenda because they require enough time for everyone to get up and speak, and people often go beyond their allotted time. We are not against having presentations as long as everyone tries to adhere to some basic principles: Give instructions in advance: The meeting organizers should provide a brief framework outlining what topics they would like the presenters to cover, so that the content supports and enhances the overall purpose of the workshop. For example, if the primary purpose of a meeting is to build new collaborations, then each talk should dedicate at least a few minutes to explicitly identifying possible areas of cross-team exchanges. An example set of guidelines can be viewed here . Keep it relevant: Presentations consume precious attention from the entire team, so in preparing a presentation a researcher should ask, \"is this content potentially relevant to everyone?\" if the answer is \"no\", then save the detailed content for later in the workshop when there are opportunities for smaller group exchanges. Keep it short, and take lots of breaks: Research on adult learning shows that our ability to absorb information is limited and we will only retain a small handful of key concepts. Therefore talks should be kept short (under 10 minutes) and sessions should be broken up with opportunities to take breaks. Never design a workshop that has hour after hour of talks with no other activities in between! Save questions for later: Question periods within or after a talk rarely achieve their intention of creating opportunities for collaboration and exchange of ideas. It is much better to have structured interactions that maximize the likelihood for as many people as possible to connect around ideas and results that surface in the presentations (see below). Stick to the schedule: Assign timekeeper duties to an administrative assist or the Project Manager. Explain to the group that everyone will be held to the time allotted, and set a countdown timer or small posters to tell people when their time is nearly up. It is the responsibility of presenters to fit their content into the time provided and to respect all the planning that goes into developing a detailed workshop schedule. Fostering cross-disciplinary flow of ideas Presentations often bring new ideas to the surface, and there will be topics that call for additional follow-up. For example, someone might wish to request access to a new research product they just learned about in a presentation. Often such collaborative exchanges end up being the most valuable part of any workshop, but they are usually left to occur opportunistically during unstructured social time, such as during the lunch or coffee break. Rather than relying on chance interactions, we advocate for esatblishing structures that explicitly maximize opportunitities for cross-team exchanges. An effective substitute for question periods after a presentation is to invite the audience to record their questions on a form that has simple prompts such as \"A possible topic we might address together is...\" or \"A way I could help you is...\" A sample worksheet form is one way to set this up. The forms are then collected by the facilitator and distributed accordingly among teams who are given time to meet together and seek out connections and exchange ideas. Teams can also hold on to the forms they receive and use these as reminders to follow up with others when they return to their home institute. Navigating complex team decisions Some of the most uncomfortable and contentious experiences at workshops occur around topics such as data sharing and attribution of effort . Nearly every researcher has experienced challenges in navigating these topics, and things can become particularly difficult in a large group with a diversity of perspectives. Nevertheless, in-person meetings are an ideal time to have courageous conversations on these topics, provided they are carefully facilitated. One facilitation approach uses TRIZ . Participants are invited to make a list of all the ways that the group could ensure they generate the worst possible result with respect to a given topic. Lists can be generated within small groups and then shared with everyone. Next, participants go down the list and assess whether any of their current ways of being in any way resemble items on the list. This allows people to generate a second list of counterprductive behaviors. Finally, teams review this second list and begin working on steps to eliminate these undesireable actions. Another approach is to have small group discussions on using the What, So What, Now What structure. The basic principle here is that conversations on difficult topics can often turn unproductive when people jump to conclusions. We minimize this by starting people off making a list of \"just the facts\", or the \"What\" of a specific topic. Next we ask of each item on this list \"So What?\" or \"Why is this item important?\". This stage generates meaning from the observations and helps people see things in a broader context. When this is complete, participants go through the list one last time and ask, \"Now What?\". Here we come up with specific actions, if any, that should follow from the obserations and meaning assigned to them. Note that in conventional conversations, many people jump into action (the \"Now What\" stage) without proceeding along this more structured \"ladder of inference\". Meeting Preparations Advanced preparation on the part of meeting participants will allow for greater productivity during the workshop. A dedicated workshop webpage goes a long way in helping people know what to expect regarding scheduling, logistics and overall workshop content. Ideally the webpage should be a dynamic, working environment that can be built on and modified during the workshop. We recommend using GitHub or other easily modified web hosting environments for such a purpose. First HiMAT workshop website The first HiMAT workshop required sharing of complex information across a new team. We built a simple webpage that not only included agenda, travel and attendance information, but also details on team science goals and directions on how to prepare lightning talks.","title":"In Person Meetings"},{"location":"InPersonMeetings/#in-person-meetings","text":"It's remarkable, given all of the scientific innovations that have occurred during the past century, that scientists continue to rely on a relatively limited range of communication tools when they gather together in person.

People can use this time to learn about new datasets, models, manuscripts and plan for upcoming events. Regular remote connections also provide chances for uncovering and eliminating roadblocks to collaboration, and they generally help to build team cohesion and positive social structures. Facilitating Remote Meetings Facilitating remote meetings is often more challenging than in person meetings. We recommend using video conferencing software such as zoom and inviting people to keep their video on but to mute their sound when not speaking. Zoom also offers capabilities for forming breakout groups within a call which can be used to enable small group discussions within a larger group call. We recommend using the chat function of the video conferencing to help minimize instances of people talking over each other.

As scientific research becomes increasingly collaborative, these traditional metrics may no longer be capable of capturing the full scope of effort that creates the modern scientific landscape. Collaboration requires an attention to the building of relationships between individuals and research teams, all of which takes time and effort. We advocate for new approaches that reward scientists in non-traditional ways that could include contributions to open-source community software libraries, participation in community building workshops and model intercomparison projects. Approach to Authorship Authorship of scientific papers remains one of the primary metrics of academic effort, and is often directly linked to an individual's career advancement. Deciding who should be included as an author and what the order of authorship should be is often the subject of intense debate. These decisions are particularly challenging because people from different disciplines, social and cultural backgrounds often have different ideas about authorship. For example, in many medical fields, being last author is a sign of prestige, whereas it means one made a minimal contribution to the effort in other fields. The importance of authorship can change over one's career. An early-career scientist may need many first-author papers to get established, while a senior researcher might be less concerned with their position in the author list. A useful guide on how to handle authorship disputes recommends the building of a culture of ethical authorship early in the publication process. As soon as an idea matures into a potential publication, researchers should have discussions within the group to define what norms of behavior whould create a positive and ethical culture around authorship. The team should agree on structures, such as pathways of communication and setting up systems for handling disputes, that ensure the authorship process proceeds smoothly. Decisions on authorship should be made before writing begins, and the roles and responsibilities of each author should be documented and updated throughout the writing process. Other useful guides include Transparency in authors\u2019 contributions and responsibilities to promote integrity in scientific publication and a paper about What constitutes authorship? . HiMAT authorship discussion HiMAT used What, So What, Now What to facilitate a discussion on authorship. We asked: \"In your wider community, what have you noticed, observed, and experienced when it comes to how decisions get made about authorship - who is included, in what order, and who gets acknowledged or left out? What are the norms?\" \" So what ? why are these norms important to notice as we publish our HiMAT results? So what, if anything, requires us to think differently about authorship and adapt?\" \" Now what ideas do you have for how we could address our potential authorship challenges?\" Many publications now require authors to articulate their particular role in preparing a manuscript. In light of this, it may be useful for everyone to put down in writing how they plan to contribute to a particular piece of work. We have used this authorship policy template with some success.","title":"Attribution of Effort"},{"location":"authorship/#attribution-of-effort","text":"Academic success is traditionally measured in terms of numbers of publications.

As soon as an idea matures into a potential publication, researchers should have discussions within the group to define what norms of behavior whould create a positive and ethical culture around authorship. The team should agree on structures, such as pathways of communication and setting up systems for handling disputes, that ensure the authorship process proceeds smoothly. Decisions on authorship should be made before writing begins, and the roles and responsibilities of each author should be documented and updated throughout the writing process. Other useful guides include Transparency in authors\u2019 contributions and responsibilities to promote integrity in scientific publication and a paper about What constitutes authorship? . HiMAT authorship discussion HiMAT used What, So What, Now What to facilitate a discussion on authorship. We asked: \"In your wider community, what have you noticed, observed, and experienced when it comes to how decisions get made about authorship - who is included, in what order, and who gets acknowledged or left out? What are the norms?\" \" So what ? why are these norms important to notice as we publish our HiMAT results? So what, if anything, requires us to think differently about authorship and adapt?\" \" Now what ideas do you have for how we could address our potential authorship challenges?\" Many publications now require authors to articulate their particular role in preparing a manuscript. In light of this, it may be useful for everyone to put down in writing how they plan to contribute to a particular piece of work. We have used this authorship policy template with some success.","title":"Approach to Authorship"},{"location":"conduct/","text":"Code of Conduct In both in-person and remote interactions, it is the responsibility of every researcher to abide by community standards of ethics and scientific integrity.

Project Solicitation Collaborative team building begins with the writing of the funding solicitation. Traditionally, researchers respond to a solicitation by gathering together a small handful of trusted colleagues. They write a proposal aimed at convincing the funding agency that their group is best equipped, and has the best ideas, to solve the problem at hand, and should therefore be funded. By funding several such teams in any particular round of funding, the idea is that at least one or two teams will generate enough new ideas to move the field forward. This funding model has generated a lot of high impact science over the years. But what if a resarch problem is too broad or complex for a single team to address? Many program managers have recognized the need for building connections across the handful of teams that get funded in a project. This is usually motivated by a desire to reduce duplication of effort and to advance the science in ways that cannot be done in isolation. A well crafted solicitation (click here for a good example) can set the stage for this collaboration to occur. The following elements are critical: Motivate the collaboration Scientists are trained to work for long hours in isolation to accomplish highly complex tasks. They usually share this work with a small set of trusted colleagues, based on relationships formed over many years. Asking them to rapidly connect with a large group of new researchers takes effort that should be clearly justified. A well crafted solicitation will provide a vision for what could be achieved through the extra effort invested in collaboration. Specific examples should be provided, for example the linking of modeling studies with field observations that will lead to improved validation and calibration. In our view, researchers should be encouraged to bring their specialty to the table (in this example, either modeling or field expertise) while describing how they would interface with teams having different expertise. One challenge we have identified is that every team, perhaps in an effort to increase their chances to be funded, proposed to do every part of the collaboration pipeline, leaving us with multiple teams \"trying to do it all\". We would rather see each team bringing a unique set of skills to the table that can then be integrated with other teams to produce something that could not have been achieved in isolation. Provide clear expectations Research scientists who spend time writing proposals get very good at estimating how much time they should request in their budgets to cover the work that needs to get done. But when cross-team collaboration is added to the mix, it gets harder to know how much extra time this will take. Researchers may wonder, should I roll the collaboration in to the amount of time I would have asked for in a less-collaborative proposal? Should I double my request? Am I expected to do the collaboration on the side? A good solicitation will offer some parameters to aid in this decision process. Providing specific guidelines, for example that some percent of effort should be dedicated to collaboration, and to plan budgets accordingly, is ideal. Provide reporting and reward structures Building and maintaining collaborations takes time that might otherwise be dedicated to writing papers and advancing one's own individual science objectives. Teams that engage most in a collaborative process may find themselves with fewer academic products such as numbers of papers published. A solicitation that truly wishes to build collaboration should describe other metrics for rewarding collaborations. This might include numbers of datasets shared, participation in leading sub-group activities or numbers of contributions to open-source software repositories. There should also be clear guidelines on how to report on these less traditional academic performance metrics. Team Selection and Composition Every agency has its own merit-based system for evaluating proposals that include metrics such as intrinsic scientific merit, relevance to the solicitation and appropriateness of the budget. These systems are designed to evaluate the potential success or failure of individual projects, but to our knowledge there are no formal metrics in place for evaluating a team's collaborative potential and likelihood for building connections across projects. One way this might be improved is by asking proposers to demonstrate how they have approached collaboration in past efforts. Specific examples could include contributions to multi-institution research articles or community open-source software packages. Once the panel review is complete the successfully-funded projects are notified. A typical solicitation funds 10 to 15 different teams, each of which is led by one lead Principal Investigator (PI) based out of a host institution who manages that particular award. Each of these PI groups often includes several co-investigators, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and technicians. Therefore the total size of the team involved in the collaboration can be anywhere from 50 to 100 people. Administrative Roles Managing and facilitating highly collaborative scientific research requires investment in a variety of administrative roles. We suggest the following positions represent a minimum level of administrative support needed to foster scientific collaboration: Program Manager The role of the program manager is to write the solicitation, guide the proposal peer-review process, allocate funds and provide big-picture guidance to the teams. For a high collaborative effort we recommend close coordination between the program manager and other administrative support described below, especially the science team lead. This will help ensure clear communication of high level programmatic needs to the broader group. Project Manager There should be a dedicated Project Manager who takes care of logistics, schedules meetings, keeps records of team membership, tracks publications, organizes in-person meetings and facilitates cross-team communications. The best project managers will have some working understanding of the broad research objectives of the teams so that they can be on the lookout for potential collaborative opportunities as they arise. Science Team Lead The Science Team Lead is selected from the pool of Principal Investigators who applied to be in this role. In the past this person has been expected to lead their own projects, guide the overall collaboration across teams, and handle logistics associated with data sharing and meeting planning. We feel that allowing the Science Team Lead to focus primarily on facilitating cross-team collaboration creates significant new opportunities. Ideally this person can learn enough of the details of projects across the entire team so that they can unleash the widest range of possibilities for innovative and high-impact research to occur. We believe top-down, hierarchical leadership approaches applied to this role are not well suited to the complex and shifting research environments typical of highly collaborative teams. We instead advocate for adaptive leadership that enables complex networks of scientists to respond with innovation and creativity as new challenges arise ( Uhl-Bien et al., 2007 ). A modern example of the role of team lead includes that of \"science integrator\" ( Brugger et al., 2016 ), a person who condenses large amounts of information and distills this to decision makers and stakeholders. Team Facilitator Successful collaboration hinges on effective communication. With everyone facing greater demands on their time, meetings between scientists need to be designed to maximize opportunities for connection and exchange of ideas. We believe that partnering with professional facilitators helps achieve these goals. A good facilitator will offer methods for structuring remote and in-person interactions in ways that challenge participants to bring their best ideas to the table, makes the most efficient use of everyone's time, and provides a framework for managing challenging discussions about authorship and data sharing. Project Data Coordinator As datasets become increasingly large and complex it has become more difficult for teams to share data across groups. Challenges include a lack of community standards with respect to data formatting and units, institutional firewalls that limit or block the transfer of large datasets, and a wide variety of available programming languages and tools. While many agencies do provide repositories for hosting data for distribution after a publication, collaborative teams also require infrastructure for sharing preliminary results and working products prior to publication. A Project Data Coordinator should be available to facilitate data sharing on secure, flexible platforms that enable file sharing across institutions. This person should also assist in creating consistent metadata, manage data sharing agreements, develop educational material for navigating technical challenges, and be an interface between researchers and the data archival centers. Principal Investigators Principal Investigators are responsible for leading their own teams. Within the scope of a collaborative effort, they also have a responsibility to represent their team's work in coordination discussions with the Science Team Lead. Principal Investigators should also play a role in facilitating communication between their team and the broader group.","title":"Team Formation"},{"location":"formation/#team-formation","text":"The foundation for building collaborative science teams begins with thoughtful design of the funding solicitation and an awareness of the multiple administrative roles needed to support collaboration.","title":"Team Formation"},{"location":"formation/#project-solicitation","text":"Collaborative team building begins with the writing of the funding solicitation.

An advantage of forming sub-groups is that collaborative exchanges tend to be more efficient.

This does not mean scheduling as many meetings, calls and online communications as is humanly possible in the hopes that collaboartion will magically occur! Instead, there should be well designed and strategically timed channels of communication baked in to the team structures early in the process, each of which is targeted to a specific purpose. Every time some form of communication is scheduled, there ought to be a simple question asked: \"What is the purpose of this meeting?\" If no one has a ready answer, then save the meeting for a later time! Personnel Chart A simple but effective way to establish and maintain a connected team is to provide everyone with a roadmap of who is on the team. At the start of the project, the Project Manager should compile a spreadsheet that contains information on each team member's name, contact information, institution and position. It is important to include everyone who may be involved in the project, from research technicians to faculty members to program managers. It is helpful to then turn this information into a chart or graphic that maps out each of the team, for example by PI group. This information should be shared freely across the team and routinely updated when people leave or join the team. Team Competencies An optional companion to the personnel chart is a summary of skills each person is bringing to the project. One approach we have used is to send out a brief survey to each team member and ask them to provide their top three skills in various categories including research domain knowledge and technical skills (e.g. computer languages and computational platforms). This information can then be made available to the full team as an add-on to the personnel spreadsheet/database. Communication Technologies There has been an explosion of new communication and collaboration tools in recent years (Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, Zoom meetings, to name a few). Often we observe a tension between people wanting to take advantage of a communication technology, and those who don't have the desire to learn something new and wish to stay with what they know. We believe teams should meet early in the process to answer these questions: What are the various categories of communication that must be in place for collaboration to occur? These may include discussions about reserach ideas, software development, team logistics and data sharing. Which existing technologies are best matched to these categories? For example, GitHub issues are an ideal place to discuss changes to computer code, whereas Slack is a great place to post team updates about an upcoming workshop. What are the absolute minimum number of these tools that we are willing to learn and commit to using throughout the course of the project? . Getting consensus on a shared set of tools is vital because the success of many of these tools depends to a large extent on the majority of team members actually using them. Below is a list of platforms with which we are familiar, and that we explored in previous projects, with varying degrees of success. Instant Messaging Instant messaging platforms offer a number of advantages when working on a collaborative effort. On these platforms, everyone in the collaboration is invited to a team forum where any postings from an individual will be viewed by everyone else. The advantage to these open forums is that no one is left out of important discussions. It also saves the administrative team a lot of time if they can post logistical updates once, for everyone to see, rather than sending out e-mails to long lists of recipients. Instant messaging platforms also provide spaces for real-time, one-on-one or small group discussions, if more privacy is needed. Slack is probably the most common instant messaging platform. Federal Agencies and Communication Platforms During the initial months of HiMAT we tried to using Slack for our internal communcations. At the time, some federal agencies such as NASA were restricted from using this technology. We instead tried \"Yammer\" a Microsoft communication tool. Be sure to explore the policies of various agencies before attempting to adopt a tool across your team! Code Sharing We strongly encourage the open sharing of code in the data sharing section. Communications about these codes belong in the well-established communication systems built into code sharing applications, the most common of which is GitHub . GitHub issues should be posted when requesting features or suggesting changes to existing scripts. GitHub organizations are also useful places for having team discussions about software. Team Website A team website can be a great tool for helping everyone to navigate the complex mix of communication tools being used in the collaboration. Early in the project, the website should be promoted as the \"first stop\" when questions arise about team logistics, scheduling and which tools to use to address a specific collaborative need. The website should be designed primarily to support the needs of the team and include features like event calendars, \"feeds\" listing upcoming events or deadlines, and links to various data sharing and collaboration resources. The website can also be a forum for sharing team results to the public, although it may be better to do this on a separate website. Web Hosting Providing regular updates on a website requires that members of the administrative team have direct access to web hosting resources. This level of access is understandably not possible if the website is hosted within a federal agency domain. A good solution is to use free web hosting services offered by GitHub. Video Conferencing Widespread fast internet speeds and advances in video conferencing applications create incredible opportunities for virtual, remote team meetings. Screen sharing, group chats and the ability to see each other in real time all contribute to productive virtual meetings. We see no reason for agencies to continue to promote audio-only conferences which are ubiquitously awkward, difficult to manage and make it easy for participants to tune-out. Shared Network Drives File sharing (which is different from the sharing of large research datasets, to be covered in data sharing ) can get extremely messy and complicated on large teams. People often provide a link to a shared document on their personal cloud-based drive (such as Google, Dropbox, or Microsoft). Then a few weeks later someone goes looking for that file and has to comb through pages of past email threads. A better approach is to set up a shared team drive so that no one needs to be be sending around links to shared files. Rather, people can just list the folder on the team drive in which the file is located. Examples include many of the \"business\" editions of commercial cloud providers such as Google Shared Drives . Federal Agencies and File Sharing As for Instant Messaging platforms above, some federal agencies do not allow their employees to use popular cloud hosting solutions like Google Drive. Communication Frequency Deciding on the frequency of team communications is delicate balancing act. Many researchers shun having to get on \"yet another team call\", but we feel this generally results from a lack of design thinking that goes into setting up team communications. If team administrators build a reputation of designing purposeful exchanges that are respectful of people's time, and that are only as long as they need to be to cover the necessary content, then more people will attend. The first In person team meting is one in which all team members should be encouraged to attend. This meeting is an opportunity to decide on the frequency of team communications, establish a code of conduct and come to agreements about authorship and data sharing .","title":"Collaboration Tools"},{"location":"tools/#collaboration-tools","text":"Building effective team communication is the cornerstone of collaborative research. This does not mean scheduling as many meetings, calls and online communications as is humanly possible in the hopes that collaboartion will magically occur! Instead, there should be well designed and strategically timed channels of communication baked in to the team structures early in the process, each of which is targeted to a specific purpose. Every time some form of communication is scheduled, there ought to be a simple question asked: \"What is the purpose of this meeting?\" If no one has a ready answer, then save the meeting for a later time!","title":"Collaboration Tools"},{"location":"tools/#personnel-chart","text":"A simple but effective way to establish and maintain a connected team is to provide everyone with a roadmap of who is on the team. At the start of the project, the Project Manager should compile a spreadsheet that contains information on each team member's name, contact information, institution and position. It is important to include everyone who may be involved in the project, from research technicians to faculty members to program managers. It is helpful to then turn this information into a chart or graphic that maps out each of the team, for example by PI group. This information should be shared freely across the team and routinely updated when people leave or join the team.","title":"Personnel Chart"},{"location":"tools/#team-competencies","text":"An optional companion to the personnel chart is a summary of skills each person is bringing to the project. One approach we have used is to send out a brief survey to each team member and ask them to provide their top three skills in various categories including research domain knowledge and technical skills (e.g. computer languages and computational platforms). This information can then be made available to the full team as an add-on to the personnel spreadsheet/database.","title":"Team Competencies"},{"location":"tools/#communication-technologies","text":"There has been an explosion of new communication and collaboration tools in recent years (Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, Zoom meetings, to name a few). Often we observe a tension between people wanting to take advantage of a communication technology, and those who don't have the desire to learn something new and wish to stay with what they know. We believe teams should meet early in the process to answer these questions: What are the various categories of communication that must be in place for collaboration to occur? These may include discussions about reserach ideas, software development, team logistics and data sharing. Which existing technologies are best matched to these categories? For example, GitHub issues are an ideal place to discuss changes to computer code, whereas Slack is a great place to post team updates about an upcoming workshop. What are the absolute minimum number of these tools that we are willing to learn and commit to using throughout the course of the project? . Getting consensus on a shared set of tools is vital because the success of many of these tools depends to a large extent on the majority of team members actually using them. Below is a list of platforms with which we are familiar, and that we explored in previous projects, with varying degrees of success.","title":"Communication Technologies"},{"location":"tools/#instant-messaging","text":"Instant messaging platforms offer a number of advantages when working on a collaborative effort. On these platforms, everyone in the collaboration is invited to a team forum where any postings from an individual will be viewed by everyone else. The advantage to these open forums is that no one is left out of important discussions. It also saves the administrative team a lot of time if they can post logistical updates once, for everyone to see, rather than sending out e-mails to long lists of recipients. Instant messaging platforms also provide spaces for real-time, one-on-one or small group discussions, if more privacy is needed. Slack is probably the most common instant messaging platform. Federal Agencies and Communication Platforms During the initial months of HiMAT we tried to using Slack for our internal communcations. At the time, some federal agencies such as NASA were restricted from using this technology. We instead tried \"Yammer\" a Microsoft communication tool. Be sure to explore the policies of various agencies before attempting to adopt a tool across your team!","title":"Instant Messaging"},{"location":"tools/#code-sharing","text":"We strongly encourage the open sharing of code in the data sharing section. Communications about these codes belong in the well-established communication systems built into code sharing applications, the most common of which is GitHub . GitHub issues should be posted when requesting features or suggesting changes to existing scripts. GitHub organizations are also useful places for having team discussions about software.","title":"Code Sharing"},{"location":"tools/#team-website","text":"A team website can be a great tool for helping everyone to navigate the complex mix of communication tools being used in the collaboration. Early in the project, the website should be promoted as the \"first stop\" when questions arise about team logistics, scheduling and which tools to use to address a specific collaborative need. The website should be designed primarily to support the needs of the team and include features like event calendars, \"feeds\" listing upcoming events or deadlines, and links to various data sharing and collaboration resources. The website can also be a forum for sharing team results to the public, although it may be better to do this on a separate website. Web Hosting Providing regular updates on a website requires that members of the administrative team have direct access to web hosting resources. This level of access is understandably not possible if the website is hosted within a federal agency domain. A good solution is to use free web hosting services offered by GitHub.","title":"Team Website"},{"location":"tools/#video-conferencing","text":"Widespread fast internet speeds and advances in video conferencing applications create incredible opportunities for virtual, remote team meetings. Screen sharing, group chats and the ability to see each other in real time all contribute to productive virtual meetings. We see no reason for agencies to continue to promote audio-only conferences which are ubiquitously awkward, difficult to manage and make it easy for participants to tune-out.","title":"Video Conferencing"},{"location":"tools/#shared-network-drives","text":"File sharing (which is different from the sharing of large research datasets, to be covered in data sharing ) can get extremely messy and complicated on large teams. People often provide a link to a shared document on their personal cloud-based drive (such as Google, Dropbox, or Microsoft). Then a few weeks later someone goes looking for that file and has to comb through pages of past email threads. A better approach is to set up a shared team drive so that no one needs to be be sending around links to shared files. Rather, people can just list the folder on the team drive in which the file is located. Examples include many of the \"business\" editions of commercial cloud providers such as Google Shared Drives . Federal Agencies and File Sharing As for Instant Messaging platforms above, some federal agencies do not allow their employees to use popular cloud hosting solutions like Google Drive.","title":"Shared Network Drives"},{"location":"tools/#communication-frequency","text":"Deciding on the frequency of team communications is delicate balancing act.

Therefore it is important that structures be put in place to facilitate both a discovery of overlapping work, as well an opportunity for teams to adjust their workplans so that their work can be collaborative and complementary. HiMAT Case study At the start of the HiMAT project, the program manager and science team lead identified overlapping tasks in several proposals. We initiated small group calls to talk through areas of overlap and to discuss possibilities for reducing duplication of effort. These conversations continued during the first in-person team meeting. Shortly after the team meeting, Principal Investigators were asked to submit revised statements of work that helped streamline areas of overlap.
