The approaches described here come out of experimentation with the hackweek model designed within the Moore/Sloan Data Science Environment . Previous events include astrohackweek , geohackweek , neurohackadamey , waterhackweek , oceanhackweek and Cryospheric Sciences with ICESat-2 hackweek . In general, hackweeks aim to blend the best elements of summer schools and hackathons. There is no one right way to host and facilitate these events, and each version of our hack-events have experimented with a range of different approaches. This documentation is intended to serve as a general reference for event planners to choose from a range of tools that we have found work well. Specific implmentations will depend on the group size, the level to which particular communities have already adopted open source and reproducible methods, and the specific learning objectives of each event.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#overview","text":"This documentation provides information on methods for hosting and facilitating data science educational workshops, in particular short (1-2 week) interactive, participant-driven events.

Hackweeks are a relatively new learning model, so participants may arrive on the first day not knowing quite what to expect. Careful planning of the open session can help alleviate participant anxiety by establishing a code of conduct and norms of behavior, and setting intentions around building a welcoming learning environment. We detail below a variety of topics and activities that can be included in the opening session. We have experimented with opening sessions lasting as long as 1.5 hours, and the length will depend on the total number of activities planned.
