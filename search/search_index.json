Project Solicitation Collaborative team building begins with the writing of the funding solicitation. A solicitation is a short document advertising an opportunity for researchers to apply for funding to work on a specific project. Traditionally, researchers gather together a small handful of trusted colleagues and write a proposal aimed at convincing the funding agency that their group is best equipped, and has the best ideas, to solve the problem at hand, and should therefore be funded. By funding several such teams in any particular round of funding, the idea is that at least one or two teams will generate enough new ideas to move the field forward. This funding model has generated a lot of high impact science over the years. But what if a resarch problem is too broad or complex for a single team to address? Many program managers have recognized the need for building connections across the handful of teams that get funded in a project. This is usually motivated by a desire to reduce duplication of effort and to advance the science in ways that cannot be done in isolation. A well crafted solicitation (click here for a good example) can set the stage for this collaboration to occur. The following elements are critical: Motivate the collaboration Scientists are trained to work for long hours in isolation to accomplish highly complex tasks. They usually share this work with a small set of trusted colleagues, based on relationships formed over many years. Asking them to rapidly connect with a large group of new researchers takes effort that should be clearly justified. A well crafted solicitation will provide a vision for what could be achieved through the extra effort invested in collaboration. Specific examples should be provided, for example the linking of modeling studies with field observations that will lead to improved validation and calibration. In our view, researchers should be encouraged to bring their specialty to the table (in this example, either modeling or field expertise) while describing how they would interface with teams having different expertise. One challenge we have identified in past collaborative efforts is that every team, perhaps in an effort to increase their chances to be funded, proposed to do every part of the collaboration pipeline, leaving us with multiple teams \"trying to do it all\". We would rather see each team bringing a unique set of skills to the table that can then be integrated with other teams to produce something that could not have been achieved in isolation. Provide clear expectations Research scientists who spend time writing proposals get very good at estimating how much time they should request in their budgets to cover the work that needs to get done. But when cross-team collaboration is added to the mix, it gets harder to know how much extra time this will take. Researchers may wonder, should I roll the collaboration in to the amount of time I would have asked for in a less-collaborative proposal? Should I double my request? Am I expected to do the collaboration on the side? A good solicitation will offer some parameters to aid in this decision process. Providing specific guidelines, for example that some percent of effort should be dedicated to collaboration, and to plan budgets accordingly, is ideal. Provide reporting and reward structures Building and maintaining collaborations takes time that might otherwise be dedicated to writing papers and advancing one's own individual science objectives. Teams that engage most in a collaborative process may find themselves with fewer academic products to show for that fulfill traditional metrics, primarily numbers of papers published. A solicitation that truly wishes to build collaboration should describe other metrics for rewarding collaborations. This might include numbers of datasets shared, participation in leading sub-group activities, numbers of contributions to open-source software repositories, or other tasks. There should also be clear guidelines on how to report on these less traditional academic performance metrics. Team Selection and Composition Every agency has its own merit-based system for evaluating proposals that include metrics such as intrinsic scientific merit, relevance to the solicitation and appropriateness of the budget. These systems are designed to evaluate the potential success or failure of individual projects, but to our knowledge there are no formal metrics in place for evaluating a team's collaborative potential and likelihood for building connections across projects. One way this might be improved is by asking proposers to demonstrate how they have approached collaboration in past efforts. Specific examples could include contributions to multi-institution research articles or community open-source software packages. Once the panel review is complete the successfully-funded projects are notified. A typical solicitation funds 10 to 15 different teams, each of which is led by one lead Principal Investigator (PI) based out of a host institution who manages that particular award. Each of these PI groups often includes several co-investigators, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and technicians. Therefore the total size of the team involved in the collaboration can be anywhere from 50 to 100 people. Administrative Roles Managing and facilitating highly collaborative scientific research requires investment in a variety of administrative roles. We suggest the following positions represent a minimum level of administrative support needed to foster scientific collaboration. Program Manager The role of the program manager is to write the solicitation, guide the proposal peer-review process, allocate funds and provide big-picture guidance to the teams. For a high collaborative effort we recommend close coordination between the program manager and other administrative support described below, especially the science team lead. This will help ensure clear communication of high level programmatic needs to the group. Project Manager There should be a dedicated Project Manager who takes care of logistics, schedules meetings, keeps records of team membership, tracks publications, organizes in-person meetings and facilitates communication between all the various players. The best project managers will have some working understanding of the broad research objectives of the teams so that they can be on the lookout for potential collaborative opportunities as they arise. Science Team Lead The Science Team Lead is selected from the pool of Principal Investigators who applied to be in this role. In the past this person has been expected to lead their own projects, guide the overall collaboration across teams, and handle logistics associated with data sharing and meeting planning. We feel that allowing the Science Team Lead to focus primarily on facilitating cross-team collaboration creates significant new opportunities. Ideally this person can learn enough of the details of projects across the entire team so that they can unleash the widest range of possibilities for innovative and high-impact research to occur. We believe top-down, hierarchical leadership approaches applied to this role are not well suited to the complex and shifting research environments typical of highly collaborative teams. We instead advocate for adaptive leadership that enables complex networks of scientists to respond with innovation and creativity as new challenges arise ( Uhl-Bien et al., 2007 ). A modern example of the role of team lead includes that of \"science integrator\" ( Brugger et al., 2016 ), a person who condenses large amounts of information and distills this to decision makers and stakeholders. Team Facilitator Successful collaboration hinges on effective communication. With everyone facing greater demands on their time, meetings between scientists need to be designed to maximize opportunities for connection and exchange of ideas. We believe that partnering with professional facilitators helps achieve these goals. A good facilitator will offer methods for structuring remote and in-person interactions in ways that challenge participants to bring their best ideas to the table, makes the most efficient use of everyone's time, and provides a framework for managing challenging discussions about authorship and data sharing. Project Data Coordinator As datasets become increasingly large and complex it has become more difficult for teams to share data across groups. Challenges include a lack of community standards with respect to data formatting and units, institutional firewalls that limit or block the transfer of large datasets, and a wide variety of available programming languages and tools. While many agencies do provide repositories for hosting data for distribution after a publication, collaborative teams also require infrastructure for sharing preliminary results and working products prior to publication. A Project Data Coordinator should be available to facilitate data sharing on secure, flexible platforms that enable file sharing across institutions. This person should also assist in creating consistent metadata, manage data sharing agreements, develop educational material for navigating technical challenges, and be an interface between researchers and the data archival centers. Principal Investigators Principal Investigators are responsible for leading their own teams. Within the scope of a collaborative effort, they also have a responsibility to represent their team's work in coordination discussions with the Science Team Lead. Principal Investigators should also play a role in facilitating communication between their team and the broader group.","title":"Team Formation"},{"location":"formation/#team-formation","text":"The foundation for building collaborative science teams begins with thoughtful design of the funding solicitation and an awareness of the multiple administrative roles needed to support collaboration.","title":"Team Formation"},{"location":"formation/#project-solicitation","text":"Collaborative team building begins with the writing of the funding solicitation.

This does not mean scheduling as many meetings, calls and online communications as is humanly possible in the hopes that collaboartion will magically occur! Instead, there should be well designed and strategically timed channels of communication baked in to the team structures early in the process, each of which is targeted to a specific purpose. Every time some form of communication is scheduled, there ought to be a simple question asked: \"What is the purpose of this meeting?\". If no one has a ready answer, then no meeting should occur! Personnel Chart A simple but effective way to establish and maintain a connected team is to provide everyone with a roadmap of who is on the team. At the start of the project, the Project Manager should compile a spreadsheet that contains information on each team member's name, contact information, institution and position. It is important to include everyone who may be involved in the project, from research technicians to faculty to program managers. It is helpful to then turn this information into a chart or graphic that maps out each of the team, for example by PI group. This information should be shared freely across the team and routinely updated when people leave or join the team. Team Competencies An optional companion to the personnel chart is a summary of skills each person is bringing to the project. One approach we have used is to send out a brief survey to each team member and ask them to provide their top three skills in various categories including research domain knowledge and technical skills (e.g. computer languages and computational platforms). This information can then be made available to the full team as an add-on to the personnel spreadsheet/database. Communication Technologies There has been an explosion of new communication and collaboration tools in recent years (Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, Zoom meetings, to name a few). Often we observe a tension between people wanting to take advantage of a communication technology, and those who don't have the desire to learn something new and wish to stay with what they know. We believe teams should meet early in the process to answer these questions: (1) \"What are the various categories of communication that must be in place for collaboration to occur?\". These may include discussions about reserach ideas, software development, team logistics and data sharing. Then (2) \"Which existing technologies are best matched to these categories?\". For example, GitHub issues are an ideal place to discuss changes to computer code, whereas Slack is a great place to post team updates about an upcoming workshop. Finally (3), \"What are the absolute minimum number of these tools that we are willing to learn and commit to using throughout the course of the project?\". Getting consensus on a shared set of tools is vital because the success of many of these tools depends to a large extent on the majority of team members actually using them. Below is a list of platforms with which we are familiar, and that we explored in previous projects, with varying degrees of success. Instant Messaging In our view, instant messaging platforms are well suited to support the types of collaborations described here. On these platforms, everyone in the collaboration is invited to a team forum where any postings from an individual will be viewed by everyone else. The advantage to these open forums is that no one is left out of important discussions. It also saves the administrative team a lot of time if they can post logistical updates once, for everyone to see, rather than sending out e-mails to long lists of recipients. Instant messaging platforms also provide spaces for real-time, one-on-one or small group discussions, if more privacy is needed. Slack is probably the most common instant messaging platform. Federal Agencies and Communication Platforms During the initial months of HiMAT Phase 1 we tried to using Slack for our internal communcations. At the time, some federal agencies such as NASA were restricted from using this technology. We instead tried \"Yammer\" a Microsoft communication tool. Be sure to explore the policies of various agencies before attempting to adopt a tool across your team! Code Sharing We strongly encourage the open sharing of code in the data sharing section. Communications about these codes belong in the well-established communication systems built into code sharing applications, the most common of which is GitHub . GitHub issues should be posted when requesting features or suggesting changes to existing scripts. GitHub organizations are also useful places for having team discussions about software. Team Website A team website can be a great tool for helping everyone to navigate the complex mix of communication tools being used in the collaboration. Early in the project, the website should be promoted as the \"first stop\" when questions arise about team logistics, scheduling and which tools to use to address a specific collaborative need. The website should be designed primarily to support the needs of the team and include features like event calendars, \"feeds\" listing upcoming events or deadlines, and links to various data sharing and collaboration resources. The website can also be a forum for sharing team results to the public, although it may be better to do this on a separate website. Web Hosting Providing regular updates on a website requires that members of the administrative team have direct access to web hosting resources. This level of access is understandably not possible if the website is hosted within a federal agency domain. A good solution is to use free web hosting services offered by GitHub. Video Conferencing Widespread fast internet speeds and advances in video conferencing applications create incredible opportunities for virtual, remote team meetings. Screen sharing, group chats and the ability to see each other in real time all contribute to productive virtual meetings. We see no reason for agencies to continue to promote audio-only conferences which are ubiquitously awkward, difficult to manage and make it easy for participants to tune-out. Shared Network Drives File sharing (which is different from the sharing of large research datasets, to be covered in data sharing ) can get extremely messy and complicated on large teams. People often provide a link to a shared document on their personal cloud-based drive (such as Google, Dropbox, or Microsoft). Then a few weeks later someone goes looking for that file and has to comb through pages of past email threads. A better approach is to set up a shared team drive so that no one needs to be be sending around links to shared files. Rather, people can just list the folder on the team drive in which the file is located. Federal Agencies and File Sharing As for Instant Messaging platforms above, some federal agencies do not allow their employees to use popular cloud hosting solutions like Google Drive. Communication Frequency Deciding on the frequency of team communications is delicate balancing act. In general academics tend to prefer spending long periods of time alone, which is necessary for completing highly complex research tasks. Unfortunately this model of work creates the potential for missed collaborative opportunities and increases the liklihood for duplication of effort. Sadly, many researchers shun having to get on \"yet another team call\", but we feel this generally results from a lack of design thinking that goes into setting up team communications, and an overall lack clarity in the purpose for the communiation. The first In person team meting is one in which all team members should be encouraged to attend. This meeting is an opportunity to decide on the frequency of team communications, establish a code of conduct and come to agreements about authorship and data sharing .","title":"Collaboration Tools"},{"location":"tools/#collaboration-tools","text":"Building of effective team communication is the cornerstone of collaborative research.

Below is a list of platforms with which we are familiar, and that we explored in previous projects, with varying degrees of success.","title":"Communication Technologies"},{"location":"tools/#instant-messaging","text":"In our view, instant messaging platforms are well suited to support the types of collaborations described here. On these platforms, everyone in the collaboration is invited to a team forum where any postings from an individual will be viewed by everyone else. The advantage to these open forums is that no one is left out of important discussions. It also saves the administrative team a lot of time if they can post logistical updates once, for everyone to see, rather than sending out e-mails to long lists of recipients. Instant messaging platforms also provide spaces for real-time, one-on-one or small group discussions, if more privacy is needed. Slack is probably the most common instant messaging platform. Federal Agencies and Communication Platforms During the initial months of HiMAT Phase 1 we tried to using Slack for our internal communcations. At the time, some federal agencies such as NASA were restricted from using this technology. We instead tried \"Yammer\" a Microsoft communication tool. Be sure to explore the policies of various agencies before attempting to adopt a tool across your team!","title":"Instant Messaging"},{"location":"tools/#code-sharing","text":"We strongly encourage the open sharing of code in the data sharing section. Communications about these codes belong in the well-established communication systems built into code sharing applications, the most common of which is GitHub . GitHub issues should be posted when requesting features or suggesting changes to existing scripts. GitHub organizations are also useful places for having team discussions about software.","title":"Code Sharing"},{"location":"tools/#team-website","text":"A team website can be a great tool for helping everyone to navigate the complex mix of communication tools being used in the collaboration. Early in the project, the website should be promoted as the \"first stop\" when questions arise about team logistics, scheduling and which tools to use to address a specific collaborative need. The website should be designed primarily to support the needs of the team and include features like event calendars, \"feeds\" listing upcoming events or deadlines, and links to various data sharing and collaboration resources. The website can also be a forum for sharing team results to the public, although it may be better to do this on a separate website. Web Hosting Providing regular updates on a website requires that members of the administrative team have direct access to web hosting resources. This level of access is understandably not possible if the website is hosted within a federal agency domain. A good solution is to use free web hosting services offered by GitHub.","title":"Team Website"},{"location":"tools/#video-conferencing","text":"Widespread fast internet speeds and advances in video conferencing applications create incredible opportunities for virtual, remote team meetings. Screen sharing, group chats and the ability to see each other in real time all contribute to productive virtual meetings. We see no reason for agencies to continue to promote audio-only conferences which are ubiquitously awkward, difficult to manage and make it easy for participants to tune-out.","title":"Video Conferencing"},{"location":"tools/#shared-network-drives","text":"File sharing (which is different from the sharing of large research datasets, to be covered in data sharing ) can get extremely messy and complicated on large teams. People often provide a link to a shared document on their personal cloud-based drive (such as Google, Dropbox, or Microsoft). Then a few weeks later someone goes looking for that file and has to comb through pages of past email threads. A better approach is to set up a shared team drive so that no one needs to be be sending around links to shared files. Rather, people can just list the folder on the team drive in which the file is located. Federal Agencies and File Sharing As for Instant Messaging platforms above, some federal agencies do not allow their employees to use popular cloud hosting solutions like Google Drive.","title":"Shared Network Drives"},{"location":"tools/#communication-frequency","text":"Deciding on the frequency of team communications is delicate balancing act. In general academics tend to prefer spending long periods of time alone, which is necessary for completing highly complex research tasks. Unfortunately this model of work creates the potential for missed collaborative opportunities and increases the liklihood for duplication of effort. Sadly, many researchers shun having to get on \"yet another team call\", but we feel this generally results from a lack of design thinking that goes into setting up team communications, and an overall lack clarity in the purpose for the communiation. The first In person team meting is one in which all team members should be encouraged to attend. This meeting is an opportunity to decide on the frequency of team communications, establish a code of conduct and come to agreements about authorship and data sharing .","title":"Communication Frequency"},{"location":"workplan/","text":"Discovering Complementary and Overlapping Work Once a team is formed the building of collaborative structures can begin. One of the greatest potential barriers to cross-team collaboration is that multiple teams may have proposed to do similar tasks. This may set up a tension within the group as each researcher tries to be the first to publish and gain credit for a specific activitity. Therefore it is important that structures be put in place to facilitate both a discovery of overlapping work, as well an opportunity for teams to adjust their workplans so that their work can be collaborative and complementary. HiMAT Case study During HiMAT Phase 1, the program manager and science team lead identified overlapping tasks in several proposals. We initiated small group calls to talk through areas of overlap and to discuss possibilities for reducing duplication of effort. These conversations continued during the first in-person team meeting. Shortly after the team meeting, Principal Investigators were asked to submit revised statements of work that helped streamline areas of overlap. In several cases individuals let go of some proposed tasks, recognizing that others had more advanced capabilities. In other cases, dupilcation of effort was seen as a positive way to check each other's work and to come at a problem from multiple directions.","title":"Revised Workplans"},{"location":"workplan/#discovering-complementary-and-overlapping-work","text":"Once a team is formed the building of collaborative structures can begin.
